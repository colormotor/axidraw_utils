# AxiDraw TCP/IP client and server

Utilties for setting up a TCP/IP connection with the AxiDraw V3 plotter.

## Server
The server code is in Python and is a slightly modified version of [this one](https://lurkertech.com/axiserver/) developed by Chris Pirazzi and Paul Haeberli. The code here provides addition options for plotting a title to each plot, and support for command line options.

## Clients
The repository contains two simple clients, one for Python 3 and one for Matlab (probably Octave also but haven't tested it yet). The clients are easy to use and brief usage examples are given in the example files.
